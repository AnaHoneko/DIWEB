        <h2>Parallax Effect</h2>
        <p>One of the most popular destinations worldwide and the top Greek destination, Santorini, or Thira, is one of
            the most magical places you’ve ever seen!</p>

            <p>Located on the southern side of the Aegean sea, Santorini Greece is a part of Cyclades island complex.
                The island was created after a huge volcanic eruption, occurred in 17th century B.C., which shaped the
                breathtaking Santorini caldera.</p>
            <p>The enthralling sunset view in Oia Santorini, the minimal Cycladic architecture, the luxurious Santorini
                Greece hotels, the dramatic rocky landscape, and Santorini volcano are just some of the reasons you’ll
                have a crush on this unique island!</p>
            <p>The island is shaped like a wonky croissant, and the neighboring islets hint at the fact that Santorini
                was once circular; it was known as Strongili (the Round One). Thousands of years ago a colossal volcanic
                eruption caused the center of Strongili to sink, leaving a caldera (or crater) with towering cliffs
                along the east side – now Santorini’s trademark landscape.</p>
            <p>Santorini’s commercial development is focused on the caldera-edge clifftops in the island’s west, with
                large clusters of whitewashed buildings nesting at dizzying heights, spilling down cliffsides and
                offering gasp-inducing views from land or sea.</p>
            <p>Fira, the island’s busy capital, sprawls north into villages called Firostefani (about a 15-minute walk
                from Fira) and Imerovigli (the highest point of the caldera edge, about a half-hour walk from Fira). A
                path running through these villages is lined with upmarket hotels, restaurant terraces and endless photo
                opportunities.</p>
            <p>These three conjoined settlements draw most visitors, together with the stunning and quite exclusive
                village of Oia in Santorini’s north. There’s a growing number of hotels in the island’s south, offering
                caldera views to the north and northeast. Akrotiri’s views come cheaper than Oia’s, but it’s a fair way
                from the action of Fira.</p>
